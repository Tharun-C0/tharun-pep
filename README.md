This project focuses on predicting house prices using Machine Learning regression techniques.
The model learns from historical housing data and predicts prices based on key features such as area, number of rooms, location-related factors, and other relevant attributes.

The complete project was implemented and executed using Google Colab, making it easy to run and reproduce.
